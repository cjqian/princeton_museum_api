This is a RESTful API for developers to access data from the museum collections. 

Find out more about the [Princeton Art Museum](http://www.artmuseum.princeton.edu) here. 

Note: this API isn't running on a server yet, so examples will use `localhost:8080` as a URL reference.

## Response Types

All responses are in [JSON](http://json.org) format. 

There are two types of responses:
